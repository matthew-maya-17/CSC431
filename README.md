# CSC431 - Final Project

This repository is the home of the Final Project for Team 10, CSC431 Spring 2022

<h1> What is UHUNGRY? </h1>
The proposed application will solve the issue of unexpected waiting times when students go to get food or drinks on campus. It will allow students to better manage their time in between classes as they can find the quickest option for dining. Users will be able to look at a map with pinned locations of food services. When selected, these pinned locations will display the name, waiting time, and description. Users will also be able to report the waiting time to update it on a regular basis. This map will either be used from Apple maps or Google maps, being able to zoom in and zoom out to give it a smooth feel. Another feature will be a scroll list with all food places with their name and waiting time is displayed. Users can sort the food places by quickest waiting time, food type, closest to me, etc. A miscellaneous button will be provided for users to self-report a new food service on campus.
