# CSC431 - Final Project

This repository is the home of the Final Project for Team 10, CSC431 Spring 2022

<h1> What is UHUNGRY? </h1>
This proposed system will allow users to create either a public or private account, where they can add recipes to their own personal cookbooks. Users can connect with other users by following them, or by creating public or private group “cookbooks” where a collaborative group will be created. Public cookbook groups will be ranked on a leaderboard to approve of any recipes. Private cookbook groups are well suited for sharing family recipes. Users will also be able to search for any recipes posted by public accounts by name, ingredients, or creator. Users may also share recipes with other users by way of a message function, so long as the recipes are publicly shared or both users are friends with the creator of the recipe. The message function may also be used to ask questions to the creator of any recipe
